Hey, I'm SuckerPayload.

I make Python projects to learn the language and I'll post them on here.

I don't always have ideas for a project so if you need a project you can contact me and I might make it:

I need money for a new PC, my current PC is 9 years old and it is really slow. I am trying to get money by donations so if you have any spare change it would be very welcome :)
